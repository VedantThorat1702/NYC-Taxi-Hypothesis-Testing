# NYC-Taxi-Hypothesis-Testing
This project is my first foray into statistical analysis, focusing on the relationship between payment types and fare amounts in the NYC yellow taxi dataset. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to help maximize revenue streams for taxi drivers. The project employs descriptive analysis, hypothesis testing  to investigate these relationships.
